# Preface

This documentation focuses on the development aspect of the referee manager.
Thus, there is no description for setting up the referee manager in a production environment.
This is part of the user documentation.

Therefore, be aware, that your passwords etc. are not secured during development, if you don't secure them yourselves.
The same goes for other security aspects.

I develop the referee manager in a virtual machine with no access from the internet, or on a laptop with no reading access from the internet.
I urge you to do so yourselves, unless you know what you are doing.

## Used Language

The developer's documentation is in English, because I think more people understand English than German and thus more people can use the referee manager.
As I am a German native speaker, you can ask German questions every time.

Die Dokumentation ist auf Englisch, damit mehr Leute die Schiedsrichterverwaltung nutzen können.
Da ich Deutsch als Mutterspreche spreche, können Sie natürlich jederzeit auch deutsche Fragen stellen.

# Structure and git repositories

There are three git sources or downloads used for development:

- CakePHP ([Homepage][url:cake], [Git][url:cake:git])
- phpMyAdmin ([Homepage][url:pma], [Git][url:pma:git], [Downloads][url:pma:down])
- Referee Manager ([Homepage][url:refman], [Git][url:refman:git])

The first two are read-only, the third, referee manager should be read/write if you want to develop.

During the development process, several files have to be located in directories of CakePHP and phpMyAdmin resp.
In order to avoid having several files mixed up, therefore making it difficult to separate referee manager files from original files, the development directories are separated from the git sources.
This means, that the development files have to be copied to and from the corresponding directories.

This will be described in detail later (see [sec:process][]).

If you do not want to use the git sources, feel free to download available snapshots and place their files in the directories stated below.

We refer to the needed directories as follows:

<...>/apache/refereemanager/
: development directory
: contains the actual website in development
: no git allowed here

<...>/apache/phpmyadmin/
: phpMyAdmin directory containing a copy of the phpMyAdmin files and the configuration file
: no git allowed here

<...>/git/refereemanager/
: referee manager git repository
: development and configuration files reside here
: development of CakePHP files does not take place here, files are copied here

<...>/git/phpmyadmin/
: phpMyAdmin git repository
: no development files here

<...>/git/cakephp/
: CakePHP git repository
: no development files here



# Required software

In order to develop the referee manager, you will need at least:

- Git
- Ant (Java)
- Apache (incl. mysql module) and PHP
- MySQL

Please install the applications for your platform.
I tested development with XUbuntu so far.

## Git

You need *git* for handling the developed code.

There are no special installation or configuration steps required in order to develop the referee manager.

## Ant

You need *ant* for execution of the setup and maintenance scripts.
*Ant* requires *Java*.
You can choose not to use *ant*, in this case you have to execute the required scripts by hand.

There are no special installation or configuration steps required in order to develop the referee manager.

## Apache and PHP

Install *apache* according to your platform.
Make sure you install the *mysql* module.

Install *PHP* as well.
Preferably combine the installation steps in order to ensure your *apache* server executes *PHP* correctly.
In order to use CakePHP scripts *PHP* has to be executable by command line too.

After each change restart apache with

	$ sudo apachectl -k restart

Execute the following configuration steps.

### Access restrictions

In standard configuration, all sites in *apache2* have access restrictions.
You have to allow access explicitely.

Handle this situation with care if you are on a live system.
In my test system I can allow access to all sites withour having to consider security issues.

After the changes, check if <http://localhost/> (still) works.

Change the following files:

- apache2.conf
- httpd.conf
- default

as follows:

#### apache2.conf

For some reason in newer *apache* installations the file `apache2.conf` does not link to `httpd.conf` anymore.
I don't know if this is a bug, a feature, a security thing or else.
In that case, add the following line to `apache2.conf`

	# Include all the user configurations:
	Include httpd.conf

Add the line before

	Include ports.conf

The file is provided in the referee manager git repository, check if a link is needed or the changes are made faster by hand.
The linking solution:

	$ cd /etc/apache2/
	$ sudo ln -s <...>/git/refereemanager/configuration/apache2/httpd.conf

#### httpd.conf

Add the file `httpd.conf` to the directory `/etc/apache2` or link the given `httpd.conf` file from the referee manager git repository.
Check if the file exists first, merge existing files if you have to.

Important changes content of `httpd.conf` in section `Directory /`:

	Options FollowSymLinks
	AllowOverride All

At the end of the file:

	LoadModule rewrite_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_rewrite.so

The linking solution:

	$ cd /etc/apache2/
	$ sudo ln -s <...>/git/refereemanager/configuration/apache2/httpd.conf

In both cases it is important to allow the following of symbolic links and the override.

#### default

Change `default` in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/` (to be tested if this change is needed).
Here too allow override and following of symbolic links in sections `Directory /` and `Directory /var/www`.

You can link to the git-stored file as well:

	$ cd /etc/apache2/sites-available/
	$ sudo ln -s <...>/git/refereemanager/configuration/apache2/sites-available/default

## Known problems

If you choose to link the needed files, there may be problems in case you encrypt your home directory.
In that case, the links can only be resolved after you log in.
You have to restart *apache* every time you log in (see [Apache and PHP][]).

## MySQL

You need *MySQL* as database server.

Make sure you install the database with the default settings and without database password.
If you choose otherwise, note the values in order to put them in the configuration files.


# Setup your working environment

Now, it is time to set up your working environment.
In order to do this, follow these steps:

1. check out the git sources
2. create and link your apache target directories
3. alter the configuration file
4. copy phpMyAdmin
5. copy CakePHP
6. copy referee manager
7. ready

You should use the provided *ant* scripts for some of these tasks.
Simply call

	$ cd <...>/git/refereemanager/scripts/
	$ ant

For a short help message, stating the available targets and a short description.
If you are not familiar with *ant*, refer to the [Ant Manual][url:ant:manual].

**Important:** All scripts work without security warnings.

## Check out the git sources

clone the code of the referee manager

	$ git clone http://git.code.sf.net/p/refereemanager/code <...>/git/refereemanager/

clone the code of CakePHP

	$ git clone git://github.com/cakephp/cakephp.git <...>/git/cakephp/

clone the code of phpMyAdmin

	$ git clone git://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin.git <...>/git/phpmyadmin/

## Create and link your apache target directories

Check if the directories exist.
If yes: delete them (check if they contain valueable files first):

	$ rm -rf <...>/apache/phpmyadmin/
	$ rm -rf <...>/apache/refereemanager/

Now create the directories:

	$ mkdir <...>/apache/phpmyadmin/
	$ mkdir <...>/apache/refereemanager/

Now link the directories to your apache home directory:

	$ cd /var/www/
	/var/www/$ sudo ln -s <...>/apache/phpmyadmin/
	/var/www/$ sudo ln -s <...>/apache/refereemanager/

## Alter the configuration file

You have to tell the scripts, where to find your directories.
Default structure is:

	../
		apache/
			refereemanager/
			phpmyadmin/
		git/
			refereemanager/
			cakephp/
			phpmyadmin/

If your directory structure is the same, you do not have to change the configuration file.

Otherwise, edit the file

	<...>/git/refereemanager/scripts/configuration.xml

Change the file according to your needs.
You can check your settings with

	$ cd <...>/git/refereemanager/scripts/
	$ ant echoproperties

## Copy phpMyAdmin

Now copy the *phpMyAdmin* files in your phpmyadmin apache directory.

Ant target
: `phpmyadmin2apache`
: call: `ant phpmyadmin2apache`

Source directory
: `<...>/git/phpmyadmin`

Target directory
: `<...>/apache/phpmyadmin`

The script executes the following steps:

1. check if target directory exists -- failure otherwise
2. delete all files and directories in the target directory
3. copy all files and directories from source directory to target directory

*Important:* Your *phpMyAdmin* configuration file is deleted too, restore it in the step [Copy referee manager][].

## Copy CakePHP
## Copy referee manager
## Start development



Now some folder have to be given more access rights in order for the application to work nicely.

- all folders that are referenced by apache have to be given read rights for apache
	- the whole path has to be readable, especially the home folder
- in `refereemanager-code/cakephp/` the following folders have to be writeable for apache:
	- `app/tmp` and all its subfolders

	$ cd <...>/refereemanager-code/cakephp/app/
	$ chmod 777 tmp
	$ cd tmp
	$ find -type d -exec chmod 777 {} \;

# Setup database

Now we are ready to set up the database.
First, link the phpmyadmin configuration file to your PHPMyAdmin folder:

	$ cd <...>/phpmyadmin
	$ ln -s <...>/refereemanager-code/configuration/phpmyadmin/config.inc.php

Now you should be able to access your database with:

	https://localhost/phpmyadmin/

Now create a database called "refereemanager".

Create the database tables using the code of

	<...>/refereemanager-code/database/refereemanager.sql

Fill the database with your data if you have some.

This means: updates of CakePHP and/or phpMyAdmin have to be copied to the development directories.
In order to avoid cluttering, in this case the development directories are deleted first.
After updates the referee manager files have to be copied to the development directories.
