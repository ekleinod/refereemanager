# Apache

After each change restart apache
	$ sudo apachectl -k restart

## Include referee manager code and phpmyadmin

Create a symbolic link to the two needed directories.
The links have to be created in
	/var/www/

	/var/www/$ ln -s .../refereemanager-code/
	/var/www/$ ln -s .../phpmyadmin

## Access restrictions

In standard configuration, all sites in apache2 have access restrictions.
You have to allow access explicitely.

Handle this situation with care if you are on a live system.
In my test system that is working local in a VM, I can allow access to all sites withour having to consider security issues.

Add the file `httpd.conf` to the directory `/etc/apache2`.
Check if the file exists first, merge existing files if you have to.

Content of `httpd.conf`:

	<Directory />
			Options FollowSymLinks
			AllowOverride All
	#    Order deny,allow
	#    Deny from all
	</Directory>

	LoadModule rewrite_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_rewrite.so

Maybe change `default`in `/etc/apache2/sites-available/`

	DocumentRoot /var/www
	<Directory />
		Options FollowSymLinks
	#	AllowOverride None
		AllowOverride All
	</Directory>
	<Directory /var/www/>
		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
	#	AllowOverride None
		AllowOverride All
		Order allow,deny
		allow from all
	</Directory>
