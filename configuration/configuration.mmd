# Apache

## Include referee manager code and phpmyadmin

Create a symbolic link to the two needed directories.
The links have to be created in
	/var/www/

	/var/www/$ ln -s .../refereemanager-code/
	/var/www/$ ln -s .../phpmyadmin

## Access restrictions

In standard configuration, all sites in apache2 have access restrictions.
You have to allow access explicitely.

Handle this situation with care if you are on a live system.
In my test system that is working local in a VM, I can allow access to all sites withour having to consider security issues.

Add the file `httpd.conf` to the directory `/etc/apache2`.
Check if the file exists first, merge existing files if you have to.

Content of `httpd.conf`:

	<Directory />
			Options FollowSymLinks
			AllowOverride All
	#    Order deny,allow
	#    Deny from all
	</Directory>

	LoadModule rewrite_module /usr/lib/apache2/modules/mod_rewrite.so
